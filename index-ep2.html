        <b>What is Lorem Ipsum?</b>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
        remaining essentially unchanged.

        <i>Where does it come from?</i><br>
        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. 
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
        and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
        discovered the undoubtable source.
